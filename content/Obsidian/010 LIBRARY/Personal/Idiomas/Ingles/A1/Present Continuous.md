### Use *Present continuos*
Use present continuous:
- For actions happening while we are speaking → The taxi’s waiting
- For actions happening around the time of speaking → Trudi’s studying animal behaviour
- Temporary situations → we’re staying at my mother’s while the builders are repaiting the roof of our house
- For talk about things that are changing as we speak
- For describe what is happening in pictures and photos


### *Continuos vs Simple*
**Action verbs:** 
- Describe an action and can usually be use in both simple and continuos
	- Janice flies around the worl → She’s flying to sydney today

**State verbs:** 
- Describe states rather than actions
	- These verbs are not usually used in the continuous form:
	- State verb:
		- Felling/Wanting: Like, love, dislike, hate, prefer, need, want, wish
			- Enjoy → Continuous
		- Thinking/Believing: Believe, doubt, forget, know, mean, realise, recognise, remenber, think, understand
		- Being/Appearing: Appear, be, seem
		- Possessing/Relating: Belong, contain, have, own, posses
		- Sense verbs: Hear, see, smell, taste
	- we can use some state verbs in the continuous form, with a different and more active meaning
		- Having breakfast
		- Thinking(considering at he momento)
		- Appearing(performing)
		- Tasting(testing)
		- Seeing(metting regularly)
	- We can also sometimes use state verb in the continuous when want to emphasise that the state is unusual or unexpected, and probably temporary.
	- Some verbs which express phycal states(feel,hurt,ache) can be used in the simple or continuos forman with no difference in meaning
