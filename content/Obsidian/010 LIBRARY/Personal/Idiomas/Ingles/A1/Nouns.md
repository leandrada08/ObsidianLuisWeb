# Possesive nouns
Certainly! Possessive nouns indicate ownership or relationship and are formed by adding an apostrophe and an "s" ('s) to the noun. Here's how it works:

1. **Singular Nouns**:
   - When a singular noun owns or is related to something, you add an apostrophe "s" ('s) to the noun.
     - Example: John's car (the car belonging to John)
     - Example: Mary's house (the house belonging to Mary)
     - Example: The dog's tail (the tail of the dog)

2. **Plural Nouns Ending in "s"**:
   - When a plural noun already ends in "s", you can either add just an apostrophe "'" or apostrophe "s" ('s) to indicate possession.
     - Example: The girls' room or The girls's room (the room belonging to the girls)
     - Example: The teachers' lounge or The teachers's lounge (the lounge belonging to the teachers)

3. **Plural Nouns Not Ending in "s"**:
   - When a plural noun does not end in "s", you add an apostrophe "s" ('s) to indicate possession.
     - Example: The children's toys (the toys belonging to the children)
     - Example: The women's clothing (the clothing belonging to the women)

4. **Nouns Ending in "-s" Sound**:
   - When a noun ends in an "-s" sound (even if it's not spelled with an "s"), you still add an apostrophe "s" ('s) to indicate possession.
     - Example: Charles's book (the book belonging to Charles)
     - Example: The bus's schedule (the schedule of the bus)

It's important to note that the use of the possessive apostrophe "s" is for ownership or relationship, not for plurals. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
